## 1. Introduction

The Data Space Decision-Making Tool is designed to help organizations determine whether implementing a data space is appropriate for their needs. It consists of two main components: a Decision Matrix and a Checklist.

## 2. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-space-decision-tool.git
   cd data-space-decision-tool
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 3. Using the Decision Matrix

The Decision Matrix provides a visual representation of when to consider implementing a data space based on the number of partners and data complexity.

To use the Decision Matrix:

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python src/decision_matrix.py
   ```
2. The matrix will be displayed, showing four quadrants.
3. Assess your situation based on the number of partners and data complexity.
4. Locate your position on the matrix to get a recommendation.

## 4. Using the Checklist

The Checklist provides a more detailed assessment of your organization's needs and readiness for a data space.

To use the Checklist:

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python src/checklist.py
   ```
2. Answer each question on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
3. After completing all questions, you'll receive a score and interpretation.

## 5. Interpreting Results

- Decision Matrix:
  - Bottom-left quadrant: Traditional data sharing methods may suffice
  - Top-left and bottom-right quadrants: Consider implementing a data space
  - Top-right quadrant: Strongly consider implementing a data space

- Checklist:
  - Score 0-35: Traditional data sharing methods may suffice
  - Score 36-55: Consider implementing a data space
  - Score 56-70: Strongly consider implementing a data space

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
- Check that you're in the correct directory when running scripts
- For visual issues with the Decision Matrix, ensure matplotlib is correctly installed
